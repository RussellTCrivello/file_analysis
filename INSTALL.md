# File Analysis — Complete Installation Guide (from zero to running)

> **Who is this for?** Someone who has never installed this application before —
> no programming knowledge required. If you can install a normal Windows program
> and open a web browser, you can do this.
>
> **Time needed:** about 30–45 minutes the first time (mostly downloads).
>
> **What you will end up with:** the File Analysis web application running on
> your own computer, opened in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## 0. The big picture (read this first — 2 minutes)

The application has **3 parts** you need to understand:

| # | Part | Plain-English explanation | You install it… |
|---|------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Python** | A tool that runs the application (like a game engine runs a game). | Once, from python.org |
| 2 | **PostgreSQL** | The database — a program that safely stores everything the app finds in your files. | Once, from postgresql.org |
| 3 | **File Analysis** | This application itself — you download it and start it. | Once, then just use it |

After installing, your **daily routine** is simply:

1. Double-click **`start.bat`** → a black window opens (leave it open).
2. Open your browser at **http://127.0.0.1:5000** → use the app.
3. When done, press **CTRL+C** in the black window (or just close it).

That's it. Everything below is just the one-time setup to get there.

### Words you will see (mini-glossary)

- **Terminal / Command Prompt / PowerShell** — the black window where you type
  text commands. On Windows 10/11: press `Win + R`, type `powershell`, Enter.
- **Browser** — Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.
- **`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`** — means "this computer itself". The app runs on
  your PC and you open it like a website, but nothing leaves your computer.
- **Password for `postgres`** — during the PostgreSQL install you invent a
  password for the database's built-in `postgres` user. **Write it down** — you
  need it once more in Step 7.

---

## PART A — Windows installation, step by step

### Step 1 — Install Python

1. Go to **https://www.python.org/downloads/** and click the big yellow
   **"Download Python 3.11"** button (any 3.10–3.12 version works; 3.11 is ideal).
2. Run the downloaded file (`python-3.11.x.exe`).
3. ⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT:** on the first installer screen, tick the checkbox
   **"Add python.exe to PATH"** at the bottom — then click **Install Now**.
   (If you forget this, nothing later will work. If you already installed
   Python without it, just run the installer again and choose *Modify*.)
4. When it says "Setup was successful", click **Close**.
5. **Check it worked:** press `Win + R`, type `powershell`, press Enter, then type:
   ```powershell
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.11.9`. ✅ If you see an error, restart
   your computer and try again (the PATH change sometimes needs a restart).

### Step 2 — Install PostgreSQL (the database)

1. Go to **https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/** and click
   **"Download the installer"** (from EnterpriseDB). Download the latest
   version (16 or newer), Windows x86-64.
2. Run the installer. Click **Next** through the screens with these choices:
   - **Installation Directory:** leave default (`C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16`) → Next.
   - **Components:** leave everything ticked (at minimum *PostgreSQL Server*) → Next.
   - **Data Directory:** leave default → Next.
   - **Password:** ⚠️ **invent a password for the `postgres` user and WRITE IT DOWN.**
     You will type it once more in Step 7. (Example: `FileAnalysis2026!` — pick
     your own.) → Next.
   - **Port:** leave **`5432`** → Next. (The app expects exactly this port.)
   - **Locale:** leave default → Next → **Finish**.
3. At the end it may offer "Stack Builder" — **untick it**, you don't need it.
4. **Check it worked:** press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, press Enter.
   In the list, find **`postgresql-x64-16`** (number matches your version).
   Its *Status* should be **Running**. If not, right-click it → **Start**.
   (Right-click → Properties → Startup type **Automatic** keeps it always on.)

> 💡 **What did I just install?** A database *server* — a program that runs quietly
> in the background and stores data. You never open it directly; the File Analysis
> app talks to it automatically.

### Step 3 — Download the File Analysis application

**Option 1 — ZIP download (easiest, no extra tools):**

1. On the GitHub page of this project, click the green **`< > Code`** button →
   **Download ZIP**.
2. Open your `Downloads` folder, right-click the ZIP → **Extract All…**.
3. Move the extracted folder to a **short path without spaces**, for example:
   ```
   C:\fileanalysis
   ```
   ⚠️ Avoid folders like Desktop, OneDrive, or paths with spaces/accents —
   they cause mysterious failures. `C:\fileanalysis` is ideal. (Your current
   location `C:\Users\Solo\Videos\file_analysis` also works fine.)

**Option 2 — with Git (if you know Git):**

```powershell
git clone <repository-url> C:\fileanalysis
```

After this step, the folder (e.g. `C:\fileanalysis`) should contain files like
`run_web.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.bat`, `start.bat`, and this `INSTALL.md`.

### Step 4 — Run the one-click setup (once only)

1. Open the application folder (`C:\fileanalysis`) in File Explorer.
2. **Double-click `setup.bat`**.
   - Windows may show a blue "Windows protected your PC" warning (because the
     file came from the internet). Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
3. A black window opens and does everything automatically:
   - creates an isolated Python environment (`.venv` — so the app never
     interferes with other Python programs),
   - downloads and installs all required packages (takes a few minutes,
     needs internet),
   - creates your personal `.env` settings file.
4. When you see **`Setup complete!`**, the window waits — press any key to close it.

> 🛠️ **What if I prefer typing commands?** The manual equivalent is:
> ```powershell
> cd C:\fileanalysis
> py -3 -m venv .venv
> .venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> copy .env.example .env
> ```

### Step 5 — (Optional but recommended) Put your database password in `.env`

The app can also get your database password from its setup page (Step 7), so
this step is optional — but doing it now removes scary-looking error messages
at the first start.

1. In the app folder, right-click the file **`.env`** → Open with → Notepad.
   (If you don't see `.env`, you skipped Step 4 — run `setup.bat` first.
   Note: `.env.example` is the template; `.env` is your personal copy.)
2. Find the line `DB_PASSWORD=` and add the postgres password from Step 2:
   ```
   DB_PASSWORD=FileAnalysis2026!
   ```
   (Use YOUR password. No quotes, no spaces around `=`.)
3. Save and close Notepad.

### Step 6 — Start the application

**Double-click `start.bat`** in the app folder. A black window opens and after
10–20 seconds you should see:

```
[OK] Starting web server on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (press CTRL+C to stop)
```

⚠️ **Leave this window open** while you use the app — closing it stops the app.
Minimizing is fine.

> 🛠️ Manual equivalent:
> ```powershell
> cd C:\fileanalysis
> .venv\Scripts\activate
> python run_web.py
> ```

### Step 7 — Complete the Database Setup page (once only)

1. Open your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox) and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
   On the very first visit you are automatically sent to the **Database Setup** page.
2. Enter **only the postgres password** from Step 2 (host, port, user and database
   name are pre-filled and standardized — don't change them).
3. Click **Setup / Initialize**.
4. Wait 10–60 seconds. The app now **automatically**:
   - creates the `analysis` database (if missing),
   - creates all tables (words, paths, contents, users, jobs, …),
   - marks the system as initialized.
5. You are redirected to the login page. ✅ Database setup is finished forever
   (this page never appears again).

### Step 8 — Log in for the first time

On first startup the app creates an **administrator account** automatically:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** the app generated a random one and saved it in a file:
  ```
  C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\file-analysis\runtime\initial_admin_password.txt
  ```
  Open that file with Notepad, copy the password, and log in.
  (Tip: paste this into File Explorer's address bar to jump there:
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\file-analysis\runtime`)

After logging in, the app forces you to **change the password** — pick something
you remember. The temporary password file is then deleted automatically.

> 🔑 **Prefer choosing the admin password yourself?** Before the first start,
> open `.env` in Notepad and set:
> ```
> APP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
> APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=choose-something-strong
> ```
> Then that password is used instead of a generated one.

### Step 9 — Verify everything works (recommended)

1. Keep the server running (Step 6 window open).
2. Open a **second** PowerShell window and run:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\fileanalysis
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   python verify_readiness.py
   ```
3. At the end you want to see:
   ```
   READINESS: READY
   ```
   If some checks fail, see [Troubleshooting](#part-e--troubleshooting)
   — most failures name the exact missing piece (usually the DB password).

### Step 10 — What to do next (using the app)

- **Analyze files:** open **Operations → Input / Ingestion** in the web interface.
  - The simplest way: **drag & drop files** into the upload area — no
    configuration needed.
  - To analyze whole folders on your disk (e.g. `D:\cases`), an administrator
    must first allow that folder: in `.env`, set e.g.
    ```
    INGESTION_ROOTS=D:\cases;E:\evidence
    ```
    (several folders separated by `;`), restart `start.bat`, then use the
    server-path option. This allowlist is a safety feature — the app can only
    read folders you explicitly permit.
- **Search & browse:** use **Search**, **Paths**, **Analytics** in the menu.
- **Import reference data:** **Operations → Import Center**.
- **Follow jobs:** **Operations → Jobs** shows live progress of long analyses
  (cancel / pause / resume supported).
- **Daily routine:** double-click `start.bat`, use the browser, press CTRL+C
  in the black window when done.

🎉 **Done! The installation is complete.**

## PART B — macOS / Linux installation

The steps are the same; only the commands differ.

1. **Python 3.11+:**
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip`
   - macOS: `brew install python@3.11` (install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) first)
   - Check: `python3 --version`
2. **PostgreSQL 14+:**
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib` then
     `sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'your-password';"`
   - macOS: `brew install postgresql@16 && brew services start postgresql@16`
   - Make sure it listens on port `5432` (default).
3. **Download & extract** the app, e.g. to `~/fileanalysis`.
4. **Setup (once):**
   ```bash
   cd ~/fileanalysis
   bash setup.sh
   ```
5. **Set the DB password** in `.env` (`nano .env` → `DB_PASSWORD=...`).
6. **Start:** `bash start.sh` → open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` → complete the
   Database Setup page → log in (initial password file:
   `~/.local/share/file-analysis/runtime/initial_admin_password.txt`).
7. **Verify:** `source .venv/bin/activate && python verify_readiness.py`.

---

## PART C — Configuration reference (`.env` file)

Your personal settings live in the `.env` file in the app folder (created from
`.env.example` by the setup script). The most important entries:

| Setting | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `DB_HOST` | `localhost` | Database computer (same PC → localhost) |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | Database port (default — don't change) |
| `DB_NAME` | `analysis` | Database name (created automatically) |
| `DB_USER` | `postgres` | Database user (default — don't change) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `your-password` | ⚠️ **Must match the Step 2 password** |
| `APP_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `admin` / `…` | Optional: choose the first admin login yourself |
| `INGESTION_ROOTS` | `D:\cases;E:\evidence` | Folders the app may read from disk (`;`-separated; empty = uploads only) |
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | `C:\fileanalysis\data` | Where uploads/logs/settings are stored (default: your user profile — usually fine) |
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | *(long random text)* | Signs login sessions; auto-generated if empty |
| `FLASK_PORT` | `5000` | Change if port 5000 is already used on your PC |

After editing `.env`, **restart** the server (CTRL+C, then `start.bat` again).

---

## PART D — Optional features (file formats)

The basic install reads TXT, HTML, E-mail, ZIP/7z/RAR archives and calendars.
For more formats, install these extras (with the virtual environment active):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install "file-analysis[pdf]"        # PDF files (recommended)
pip install "file-analysis[office]"     # Word, Excel, PowerPoint
pip install "file-analysis[ocr]"        # text in scanned images (needs Tesseract installed separately)
pip install "file-analysis[ebook]"      # EPUB, MOBI e-books
pip install "file-analysis[audio]"      # audio metadata (MP3, FLAC, …)
pip install "file-analysis[media]"      # video files (large download)
```

Or everything at once: `pip install "file-analysis[pdf,office,ocr,ebook,audio]"`.
Restart the server afterwards.

---

## PART E — Troubleshooting

> **Rule #1:** after any fix, **restart the server** (CTRL+C in the black window,
> then double-click `start.bat` again) and **refresh the browser** (CTRL+F5).

### E1. `fe_sendauth: no password supplied` / `Failed to initialize connection pool`

**This is the error from the report that motivated this guide.** It means:
the app tried to reach PostgreSQL but has no password yet.

- **It's expected BEFORE you complete Step 7** (the Database Setup page) or
  Step 5 (`.env` password) — and it disappears by itself afterwards.
- **Fix (pick one):**
  1. *Easiest:* open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/setup` in the browser, enter the
     postgres password from Step 2, click Setup. Done.
  2. *Alternative:* put the password in `.env` (`DB_PASSWORD=...`, see Step 5)
     and restart the server.
- If the message **persists after setup**, the password is wrong: check
  Step 2's password, or change it (Windows: open **pgAdmin** → Servers →
  PostgreSQL → Login/Group Roles → postgres → Definition → new password →
  Save; then re-enter it in `.env` / the Settings page).

### E2. `python run_web.py` prints lines and returns to the prompt (no server)

Fixed in this version (`run_web.py` now starts the server and prints
`Starting web server on http://127.0.0.1:5000`). If you see the old behavior,
update to the latest code and use **`start.bat`**.

### E3. `python` is not recognized / `py` not found

Python isn't installed or not on PATH. Re-run the Python installer → **Modify**
→ tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** → restart the computer → retry.

### E4. `pip install` fails (red errors)

- No internet? Connect and retry.
- Corporate proxy/antivirus blocking? Try a private network, or ask IT to allow
  `pypi.org` and `files.pythonhosted.org`.
- Very old `pip`? Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` first.
- Then re-run `setup.bat` (it's safe to run twice — it skips finished steps).

### E5. Browser shows "Can't reach this site" / connection refused

- Is the black server window still open with `Starting web server...`? If not,
  double-click `start.bat` again.
- Correct address? Use exactly `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (not `https`, no typo).
- Port conflict? If another program uses port 5000, set `FLASK_PORT=5001` in
  `.env`, restart, and open `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

### E6. `connection to server at "localhost", port 5432 failed: Connection refused`

PostgreSQL isn't running. Windows: `Win+R` → `services.msc` → find
`postgresql-x64-…` → right-click → **Start**. Then restart `start.bat`.

### E7. Setup page says "Database is already initialized" but login fails

The database exists but the admin account is missing (interrupted first run).
Reset the admin account — see [E11](#e11-i-forgot-the-admin-password).

### E8. Login page loops / "Invalid username or password"

- First login ever? Use the generated password file (Step 8), not your
  postgres password — these are two different passwords!
- `Caps Lock` on? Usernames are case-sensitive.
- Account locked after 5 wrong tries? Wait 15 minutes, then retry.

### E9. I don't remember the postgres password (Step 2)

Windows: open **pgAdmin 4** (installed with PostgreSQL) → Servers →
PostgreSQL 16 → **Login/Group Roles** → right-click **postgres** →
Properties → **Definition** tab → set a new password → Save.
Then update `.env` (`DB_PASSWORD=...`) and restart the server, or update it on
the app's **Settings** page.

### E10. How do I start over with an empty database?

⚠️ This **deletes all analyzed data**. Steps:

1. Stop the server (CTRL+C).
2. Open **pgAdmin** → Databases → right-click `analysis` → Delete/Drop.
3. Delete the marker files: `.system_initialized` and `.db_config.json` in the
   app folder, and the settings store under
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\file-analysis\config` (Windows).
4. Start the server → the Database Setup page (Step 7) appears again.

### E11. I forgot the admin password

With access to the computer you can always recover:

1. Stop the server.
2. In `.env`, set a new `APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=...` (temporary).
3. Delete the users so bootstrap recreates the admin — easiest via pgAdmin:
   open database `analysis` → Query Tool → run:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM sessions;
   DELETE FROM users;
   ```
4. Start the server → the admin is recreated with your temporary password →
   log in → change it on the profile page → **remove `APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   from `.env`** and restart.

### E12. The black window shows lots of WARNING/ERROR lines at startup

Before Step 7 is completed, database-related ERROR lines are **normal** — the
app is retrying until you enter the password in the setup page. After a
successful setup + restart, startup should be mostly `✅` / `[OK]` lines.
Anything else: read the message, find it in this guide, or check
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\file-analysis\logs` for details.

### E13. Antivirus / firewall popups

- The Python/PostgreSQL installers and the local web server (port 5000) may
  trigger SmartScreen or firewall prompts. Allow **private networks** access.
  The app only needs *local* access — never expose port 5000 to the internet
  unless you know what you're doing (see `docs/SECURITY.md`).

---

## PART F — Uninstall / moving the app

- **Stop using it:** press CTRL+C in the server window. Nothing runs in the
  background except PostgreSQL (which you can leave installed).
- **Remove the app:** delete the app folder (e.g. `C:\fileanalysis`) and, if
  wanted, the data folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\file-analysis`.
- **Remove everything:** additionally uninstall *Python* and *PostgreSQL* via
  Windows Settings → Apps.
- **Move to another computer:** install Python + PostgreSQL there, copy the app
  folder, run `setup.bat`, and either re-run the setup wizard (fresh database)
  or restore a backup (`pg_dump` — see `docs/DATABASE.md`).
