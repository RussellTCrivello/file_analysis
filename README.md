# Zero Data Loss Guarantees - Production Implementation

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive fixes implemented to ensure **ZERO DATA LOSS** when processing terabyte-scale folders with all file types. Every file, folder, and piece of data is guaranteed to be discovered, processed, and stored.

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Complete Folder Traversal with Error Handling
**File**: `core/file_utils.py` - `read_tree()`

**Problem**: Original implementation would fail silently or crash on permission errors, symlinks, or very long paths, potentially losing files.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**: Catches PermissionError, OSError, and all exceptions
- ✅ **Symlink protection**: Tracks visited paths to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ **Windows path length handling**: Automatically uses extended path prefix (\\?\\) for paths >260 chars
- ✅ **Error file storage**: Files with errors are still included in the tree with error metadata
- ✅ **Root path validation**: Handles non-existent or inaccessible root paths gracefully

**Result**: **100% of files are discovered**, even if they can't be accessed. All files are stored with appropriate error information.

### 2. File Processing with Guaranteed Storage
**File**: `pipeline/integrated_reader.py` - `_process_file_worker()`

**Problem**: Files with permission errors or processing failures might not be stored in the database.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Permission error handling**: Files with permission errors are stored with error metadata
- ✅ **Non-existent file handling**: Files that don't exist are still stored with error info
- ✅ **Processing failure recovery**: Files that fail processing are stored with error details
- ✅ **Always store policy**: Every file is stored, even if processing completely fails
- ✅ **Minimal file_info creation**: Creates valid file_info even when metadata retrieval fails

**Result**: **100% of files are stored in database**, with appropriate error flags and messages.

### 3. Single File Processing Guarantees
**File**: `pipeline/integrated_reader.py` - `process_single_file()`

**Problem**: Files that don't exist or can't be accessed would return None and not be stored.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Always create file_info**: Creates minimal file_info even when file doesn't exist
- ✅ **Metadata error recovery**: Creates file_info on metadata retrieval failures
- ✅ **Error result creation**: Always creates a result dictionary, even for errors
- ✅ **Guaranteed storage**: Every file path results in a database record

**Result**: **Every file path is stored**, regardless of accessibility or processing success.

### 4. Folder Processing with Complete Coverage
**File**: `pipeline/integrated_reader.py` - `process_folder()`

**Problem**: Errors in reading directory tree could cause entire folder processing to fail.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Tree reading error handling**: Catches errors in read_tree() and creates error entry
- ✅ **ERROR type file inclusion**: Includes files with ERROR type in processing queue
- ✅ **Error file reporting**: Reports count of files with errors
- ✅ **Final verification**: Verifies all files were processed and reports discrepancies
- ✅ **Comprehensive summary**: Provides detailed processing summary with statistics

**Result**: **Complete folder coverage** - every file and error is tracked and stored.

### 5. Database Transaction Safety
**Files**: `pipeline/storage_pipeline.py`, `database/services/contents_db_service.py`

**Problem**: Database transaction failures could cause data loss.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Retry logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Fallback storage**: Falls back to minimal storage if full processing fails
- ✅ **Transaction rollback**: Proper rollback on failures
- ✅ **Error preservation**: Error information is always stored
- ✅ **Connection pool management**: Prevents connection exhaustion

**Result**: **Atomic operations** - either complete success or error is stored, never partial data.

## Data Loss Prevention Mechanisms

### 1. File Discovery
- ✅ **No silent failures**: All errors are logged and stored
- ✅ **Symlink protection**: Prevents infinite loops
- ✅ **Path length handling**: Handles Windows MAX_PATH limits
- ✅ **Permission error handling**: Stores files even if not accessible

### 2. File Processing
- ✅ **Error result creation**: Every processing attempt creates a result
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to error storage on failures
- ✅ **Memory error recovery**: Progressive chunk size reduction
- ✅ **Timeout handling**: Dynamic timeouts prevent premature failures

### 3. Database Storage
- ✅ **Always store policy**: Every file is stored, even with errors
- ✅ **Retry mechanisms**: Automatic retries on transient failures
- ✅ **Fallback methods**: Multiple storage strategies
- ✅ **Transaction safety**: Atomic operations prevent partial data

### 4. Verification and Reporting
- ✅ **Processing summary**: Detailed statistics on completion
- ✅ **Error tracking**: All errors are logged and stored
- ✅ **Checkpoint system**: Resume capability prevents re-processing
- ✅ **Final verification**: Confirms all files were processed

## Edge Cases Handled

### File System Issues
- ✅ Permission denied errors
- ✅ File not found errors
- ✅ Path too long errors (Windows)
- ✅ Symlink infinite loops
- ✅ Network drive disconnections
- ✅ Corrupted file systems

### Processing Issues

- ✅ Processing timeouts
- ✅ Format errors
- ✅ Reader failures
- ✅ Encoding errors

### Database Issues
- ✅ Connection failures

- ✅ Connection pool exhaustion
- ✅ Query timeouts
- ✅ Constraint violations

## Usage

The system is now production-ready. Simply run:

```python
from pipeline.integrated_reader import IntegratedFileReader

reader = IntegratedFileReader(
    max_workers=4,
    enable_storage=True,
    storage_source="your_source",
    storage_side="your_side",
    checkpoint_file="checkpoint.json"  # Optional, for resume capability
)

# Process entire terabyte folder
results = reader.process_folder("/path/to/terabyte/folder")
```

**Guarantees**:
1. ✅ **100% file discovery** - Every file and folder is found
2. ✅ **100% storage** - Every file is stored in database
3. ✅ **Zero data loss** - Errors are stored, not lost
4. ✅ **Resume capability** - Can resume from checkpoints
5. ✅ **Complete reporting** - Full statistics and error tracking

## Error Handling Philosophy

**Core Principle**: **Store everything, lose nothing**

- Files that can't be accessed → Stored with permission error
- Files that don't exist → Stored with "not found" error
- Files that fail processing → Stored with processing error
- Files with format errors → Stored with format error
- Database connection failures → Retried with exponential backoff

**Result**: Every file path results in a database record, ensuring complete audit trail and zero data loss.

## Unified Operations (frontend-driven)

All ingestion, import and monitoring workflows run from the web frontend —
no terminal required:

* **Input / Ingestion** (`/operations/input`) — upload (drag & drop) or
  server paths (INGESTION_ROOTS), basic/advanced options, dry run.
* **Import Center** (`/operations/import`) — domain data, backup restore
  (admin), server batch import — validate → preview → confirm.
* **Jobs** (`/operations/jobs`) — live progress, real events, cancel /
  pause / resume / retry, crash recovery.

Long-running operations execute as persistent, concurrency-limited jobs
(`services/jobs/`); HTTP only creates and controls them. The command-line
entry points `run_cli.py` and `run_import.py` are **deprecated thin
adapters** over the same services (`services/ingesting`,
`services/importing`) kept for compatibility.

operations.md, performance.md, security.md, database.md, architecture.md.
